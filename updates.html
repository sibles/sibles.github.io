      <td>
        There's a lot of changes in this update, so I'm going to use *dotpoints*:
        <ul>
          <li>Created a stylesheet for index.html (the home page), titled main.css,
            I will probably use this stylesheet for more than just the homepage
            (for starters its also on this updates page!!).</li>
          <li>I have started incorporating Google Fonts in this site. At this stage
            they're only applied to the home page and the copyright footer.</li>
          <li>Speaking of copyright footers, there is now one on the home page
            and this updates page. They are very fancy (auto updating the year)!</li>
          <li>Here's one last minor update, there is now a "Return Home" button
            at the top of this page!! (Very epic!)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>12-08-2021</td>
      <td>I, in all my great wisdom, forgot to add an update explaing that I updated
      the updates page!! So here it is, I added a table, and incorporated CSS styles
      into this page you're reading now.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>11-08-2021</td>
      <td>I made a duplicate of recipes.html (called recipes2.0.html)
        It was just me messing around with all the new found knowledge of html/css
        I have under my belt after doing this <a href="https://groklearning.com/launch/">silly little course</a>
        that Mr Simon Fajou emailed us...</td>
