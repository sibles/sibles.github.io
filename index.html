  <h1>Welcome to <span class="headings">SIBLESITE!</span></h1>
  <p>There isn't actually really any point to this website except for me to use
    it to mess around with html/css... Maybe some day in a far off future it will
    serve some purpose, but that day is far away. Anyway, I hope you enjoy your
    stay :)</p>
  <p>Here is a list of things that I'm working on/have worked on in the past:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Here is an absolutely amazing website that I highly recommend you visit:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Amazing Website</a></li>
    <li>Here is a "recipe book" type thing I made in ~2017 (I think). It's not
      particularly good, and I could do a lot better in far less time these days,
      but here you go if you're interested: <a href="recipes.html">Recipe Book</a>
      <li class="subPoint1">Alternatively here's a slightly modified version that is a completely
        mess... <a href="recipes2.0.html">Recipe Book 2.0</a></li>
    <li>Going even further back, here is a "travel webpage" I made in ~2015...
      It's even worse than the recipe book, but also considerably better
      considering I was in primary school at the time. Anyway here it is:
      <a href="travelWebpage.html">Travel Webpage</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Lastly, and most importantly for me, click <a href="updates.html">here</a> for pointless updates that you don't care about lol ;)</strong></p>
