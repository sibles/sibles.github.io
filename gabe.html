<h3>HELLO GABE <br>
  HOW ARE YOU <br>
  I WAS PLANNING ON DOING SOMETHING MORE WITH THIS <br>
  BUT THINGS TOOK LONGER THAN EXPECTED <br>
  IT IS CURRENTLY 5:16 AS IM CODING THIS <br>
  WHY AM I CODING THIS? I HAVE NO IDEA...<br>
  BUT I AM!<br>
  OK ENJOY THE BUTTON:</h3>


<button class="button button2">Button!</button>


<p>(i was going to make the font comic sans or papyrus, but it costs like over
  $50 to buy the rights to use the font and its a lot harder to pirate when
  coding a website especially when its 10 minutes before you're meant to be
  somewhere)</p>
